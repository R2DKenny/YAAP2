# Yet Another Accounting Program 2

Based on the original YAAP used by IEEE UCSD, YAAP2 aims to remove clutter and make it easier for users to navigate and identify their account balance.

It can also be used as a simple generic accounting program to keep track of expenses. (I hope.)

The program was inspired by the 3REE stack example found at [GordyD/3REE](https://github.com/GordyD/3ree). Admittedly, I'm using the same code structure as the example since I'm still trying to figure out how to piece everything together myself.

## Pre-requisites

- NodeJS
- RethinkDB

### TODO (in no specific order)

- Re-add multiuser support
- Add docker support
- Update CSS
- Use react-router
